MAMBA-TBPS: An Efficient Attribute-Relation-Sensitive Framework for Text-Based Person Search

**#Abstract**
Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) is an emerging cross-modal retrieval task that aims to identify a target individual from an image database using textual description. The challenge lies in bridging the modality gap between visual and textual inputs while addressing inter-identity ambiguity and intra-identity variations. In our proposed MAMBA-TBPS architecture, we integrate the complete loss formulation from the base model—namely, Contrastive Loss, Relation-Aware (RA) Loss, Sensitivity-Aware (SA) Loss, Attribute Loss, and MAE-based Visual Reconstruction Loss. This comprehensive loss design enables our framework to effectively capture fine-grained cross-modal relationships, maintain attribute sensitivity, and enhance visual-textual alignment, ultimately improving retrieval performance. Experimental evaluations on three TBPS benchmarks—CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid—demonstrate that MAMBA-TBPS achieves competitive performance.
